#Project: Recipe Recommender / Mario version

*Recommend recipes from recipe API*

## Reason
One of humanity's nagging question is : what do we eat today?
When your fridge only contains heterogeneous ingredients that cannot possibly match in a happy recipe you would know already, tech comes to help you find something to eat. Here where our recipe recommender comes into play. If you wonder "what can I possibly cook with this half rotten orange, leeks and pistacchio hanging around?"" well I have just the right tool for you

##Datasource
- https://spoonacular.com/food-api
- Spoonacular's Food and Recipe API provides access to over 360,000 recipes and 80,000 food products. The API enables users to search for recipes using natural language (such as "gluten-free brownies without sugar"). Users can visualize recipe nutrition and ingredient lists, analyze recipe costs, find recipes by nutritional requirements, favorite ingredients, or what's in the refrigerator, classify recipes, convert ingredient amounts, and even compute an entire meal plan. The service covers ingredients, recipes, food products, and menu items.
